				development of children and adolescents in global contexts. My research focuses on the
				dynamics of risk and resilience in child and adolescent development.</p> <p>I explore the intersectionality of home, school, and neighborhood environments to understand
				how these systems collectively influence the developmental trajectories of young people and
				their families. By examining these interactions, I aim to identify protective factors and
				mechanisms that promote healthy development, even in the face of adversity. I strive to
				integrate cultural sensitivity and contextual relevance and apply them to designing and
				evaluating interventions.</p> <p>Prior to Penn GSE, I have contributed to various research projects, including disseminating
				the Caregiver-Reported Early Development Instrument (CREDI) - a universal and
				population-level measure of early childhood development for children from birth to age
				three, evaluating the effects of intervention programs for preschool children in rural areas
				of Asia, and investigating the long-term consequences of early childhood adversities on
				human development.</p> <p>Born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam, my lived experiences have deeply shaped my commitment to
				understanding and addressing the unique challenges faced by children and families in low-
				and middle-income countries. This personal connection fuels my passion for conducting
				evidence-based research that provide better support for these communities. I earned a B.A.
				in Psychology from Oberlin College and an M.Ed. in Human Development & Education from
				Harvard University. Before pivoting to a developmental research career, I was a
				professionally trained classical pianist.</p></section></div></article>`);function r(e){var n=i();t(e,n)}export{r as component};
