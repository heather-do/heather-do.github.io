			Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Interdisciplinary Studies in Human Development at the
			University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education.
		</p>
		<p>
			My research examines how risk and protective factors, along with the intersection of home,
			school, and neighborhood environments, shape child and adolescent development in global
			contexts. I aim to use research findings to create contextually relevant intervention
			programs, inform policies, and form reliable resources that support children, adolescents, and
			their families.
		</p>
		<p>
			My work has been published in top journals in the field, including <em
				>Developmental Psychology</em
			>, <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em>, and
			<em>International Journal of Early Childhood</em>.
		</p>
