				Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Interdisciplinary Studies in Human Development at the
				University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education.
			</p>
			<p>
				My research examines how risk and protective factors, along with the intersection of home,
				school, and neighborhood environments, shape child and adolescent development in global
				contexts. I aim to use research findings to create contextually relevant intervention
				programs, inform policies, and form reliable resources that support children, adolescents,
				and their families.
			</p>
			<p>
				My work has been published in top journals in the field, including <em
					>Developmental Psychology</em
				>, <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em>, and
				<em>International Journal of Early Childhood</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
